# CostaIoTSensorProject
This is the C code and arduino setup for the Costa Farms Project. 

Here the overview of the project - 


Time consuming, costly, and difficult for growers to measure and regulate pH throughout the day and across the lifecycle of a plant.  Indeed, pH levels are one of the key factors in plant health. Furthermore, pH levels in the water and nutrient streams change constantly. 


To increase plant health via nutrient uptake in turn promoting higher yield, pH needs to be more closely monitored and adjusted in real time.The Azure loT system helps Costa Farms increase revenue and profitability in using modern technology in agriculture/farming. Recalling optimal pH levels is essential for nutrient uptake. Increased nutrient uptake directly effects yields, in turn driving improved revenue per plant harvested. On the cost side, this system will allow growers to be more productive and utilized across all growing activities as they spend less time manually checking pH values by hand.SolutionThis solution uses Microsoft Azure IoT Hub with pH sensor devices on hydro water systems testing correct pH levels. 

The goal was to use pH sensors for testing water entering and leaving the customer’s hydro systems. We used the Adafruit Feather M0 Wifi and pHSensor, Microsoft Azure and IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, Event Hub, Azure Functions, messaging via Twilio and SQL Azure. We built a “proof of concept” that customers can use in their solutions.Below is the overall flow of the system, which we’ll discuss in detail.There are multiple technologies for this particular IoT solution.
